# Database Encryption
In this project I implemented An encryption for log in System (using SHA) and Database encryption (using DES).
The goal of this project is to create an encryption system for a local database so that if this database is attacked, the attecker wont be able to decipher the DB content.
I implemented the encryptions using Pyrhon.

Hope you''l enjoy it :)
